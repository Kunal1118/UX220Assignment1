# Financial 
I want to be more on top of my finances and make sure that I am spending my money more wisely. I have already been investing my money for a long time now but I also want to make sure that I am trying to set myself up to buy a house in the next 7-10 years. This will include making sure I start putting more money into my investment portfolio.
