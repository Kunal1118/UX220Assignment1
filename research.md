# Research
The study by Cheng and Chau, investigating the influence of goal orientation on the reflective ability of electronic portfolio users, resonates with my personal goals on various levels. Much like the study, my aspirations revolve around goal-setting and self-improvement. My dream of exploring the world through travel demonstrates a goal-oriented mindset towards experiencing diverse cultures and broadening my horizons, which can potentially enhance my reflective abilities. Furthermore, my commitment to improving my physical and mental well-being reflects a dedication to personal growth, aligning with the study's focus on personal development through goal orientation. Transitioning into a career as a math teacher signifies my professional ambitions, driven by a clear goal to make a meaningful impact through education. Lastly, my financial objective of purchasing a house in the next 7-10 years highlights my long-term financial planning and determination, mirroring the importance of goal setting and reflection emphasized in the study. Both the research and my personal goals underscore the pivotal role of setting and pursuing objectives in achieving personal and professional success.
